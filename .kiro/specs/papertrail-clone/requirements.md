# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an open-source alternative to Papertrail, a log collection and analysis service. The system will be a single-binary Go application that listens for log messages over TCP, stores them in SQLite with full-text search capabilities, and provides a clean web-based terminal-like interface for viewing and filtering logs. The primary goals are simplicity of deployment (single binary), performance, and an intuitive user interface that matches or exceeds the usability of existing solutions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy a log collection service as a single binary, so that I can quickly set up log aggregation without managing multiple services or complex configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL produce a single executable binary with no external dependencies
2. WHEN the binary is executed THEN the system SHALL automatically create the SQLite database and required tables if they don't exist
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL bind to a configurable TCP port (default 2253) for log ingestion
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL start a web server on a configurable HTTP port (default 8080) for the UI

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send log messages to the service over TCP in a structured format, so that my applications can easily integrate with the log collection system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TCP connection is established THEN the system SHALL accept incoming log messages as newline-delimited strings
2. WHEN a log message is received THEN the system SHALL parse it according to a configurable format (default: "timestamp|level|tracking_id|message")
3. WHEN a log message cannot be parsed THEN the system SHALL store it as-is with a default level of "unknown" and current timestamp
4. WHEN a log message is successfully parsed THEN the system SHALL extract timestamp, level, tracking_id, and message fields
5. WHEN a log message is processed THEN the system SHALL store it in SQLite with FTS5 indexing on the message field

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to view logs in a terminal-like interface, so that I can quickly scan through log entries in a familiar format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the web interface THEN the system SHALL display logs in a dark terminal-like theme with monospace font
2. WHEN logs are displayed THEN the system SHALL show timestamp, level, tracking_id, and message in a readable format
3. WHEN new logs arrive THEN the system SHALL automatically update the display in real-time
4. WHEN I scroll up THEN the system SHALL pause auto-scrolling to allow reading historical logs with paging
5. WHEN I scroll to the bottom THEN the system SHALL resume auto-scrolling for new logs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want to filter logs by various criteria, so that I can quickly find relevant log entries without scrolling through thousands of unrelated messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter text in the search box THEN the system SHALL filter logs using full-text search on the message field
2. WHEN I select a log level filter THEN the system SHALL show only logs matching that level or higher severity
3. WHEN I enter a tracking ID filter THEN the system SHALL show only logs matching that specific tracking ID
4. WHEN I set a time range filter THEN the system SHALL show only logs within the specified time period
5. WHEN multiple filters are applied THEN the system SHALL show logs matching ALL filter criteria
6. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL return to showing all logs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the log storage to be efficient and searchable, so that the system can handle high log volumes without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN logs are stored THEN the system SHALL use SQLite with FTS5 for efficient full-text search
2. WHEN the database grows large THEN the system SHALL maintain acceptable query performance through proper indexing
3. WHEN storage space becomes a concern THEN the system SHALL support configurable log retention policies
4. WHEN the system starts THEN the system SHALL create appropriate database indexes for timestamp, level, and tracking_id fields

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the service behavior, so that I can adapt it to different deployment environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from command-line flags or environment variables
2. WHEN no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for all settings
3. WHEN TCP port is configured THEN the system SHALL bind to the specified port for log ingestion
4. WHEN HTTP port is configured THEN the system SHALL serve the web interface on the specified port
5. WHEN log format is configured THEN the system SHALL parse incoming messages according to the specified format
6. WHEN database path is configured THEN the system SHALL use the specified location for SQLite storage

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle connection failures gracefully, so that temporary network issues don't cause log loss or system crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a TCP client disconnects unexpectedly THEN the system SHALL continue accepting new connections
2. WHEN the database is temporarily locked THEN the system SHALL retry operations with exponential backoff
3. WHEN the system encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log errors to stderr without crashing
4. WHEN memory usage grows high THEN the system SHALL implement backpressure to prevent out-of-memory conditions
5. WHEN the web interface loses connection THEN the system SHALL attempt to reconnect automatically
