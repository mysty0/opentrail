# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the SQLite storage layer to improve performance and maintain real-time responsiveness by implementing batched writes, enabling WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode, and making storage operations non-blocking. The goal is to optimize database write performance while ensuring that real-time log streaming remains responsive and unaffected by database write operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator monitoring high-volume log streams, I want the log storage to handle high write throughput efficiently, so that the system can process thousands of logs per second without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives multiple log entries THEN the storage SHALL batch multiple inserts into a single database transaction
2. WHEN a batch reaches the configured batch size THEN the storage SHALL immediately execute the batch insert
3. WHEN a batch timeout is reached THEN the storage SHALL execute the current batch regardless of size
4. WHEN batch processing fails THEN the storage SHALL retry individual inserts to prevent data loss
5. WHEN the system is under high load THEN write throughput SHALL be at least 5x better than individual inserts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer using the log monitoring system, I want real-time log updates to remain responsive during high write volumes, so that I can see new logs immediately without delays caused by database operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storage operations are executing THEN real-time subscribers SHALL continue to receive log updates without blocking
2. WHEN batch writes are in progress THEN the storage operation SHALL be non-blocking for the calling service
3. WHEN a log entry is processed THEN subscribers SHALL receive the entry before database write completion
4. WHEN the storage queue is full THEN the system SHALL apply backpressure gracefully without blocking real-time updates

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the SQLite database to use WAL mode for better concurrency and crash recovery, so that read operations don't block write operations and the system is more resilient to unexpected shutdowns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the SQLite database is initialized THEN it SHALL be configured to use WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode
2. WHEN write operations are in progress THEN read operations SHALL not be blocked
3. WHEN read operations are in progress THEN write operations SHALL not be blocked
4. WHEN the system crashes during write operations THEN the database SHALL recover automatically on restart
5. WHEN WAL files grow large THEN the system SHALL periodically checkpoint to manage file sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want configurable batching parameters, so that I can tune the system for different workload patterns and performance requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the storage is initialized THEN it SHALL accept configuration for batch size, batch timeout, and queue size
2. WHEN batch size is configured THEN the storage SHALL use that value for batching decisions
3. WHEN batch timeout is configured THEN the storage SHALL use that timeout for batch processing
4. WHEN queue size is configured THEN the storage SHALL limit the internal queue to that size
5. WHEN configuration values are invalid THEN the storage SHALL use sensible defaults

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the storage interface to remain unchanged, so that existing code continues to work without modifications while benefiting from the performance improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the new batched storage is implemented THEN it SHALL implement the existing LogStorage interface
2. WHEN existing code calls Store() THEN it SHALL work without modification
3. WHEN the storage is used in tests THEN existing tests SHALL continue to pass
4. WHEN the service layer calls storage methods THEN the behavior SHALL be functionally equivalent to the current implementation
5. WHEN storage operations complete THEN the LogEntry ID SHALL be populated as before
